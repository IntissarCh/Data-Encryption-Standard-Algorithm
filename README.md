Data-Encryption-Standard-Algorithm
==================================

Data Encryption Standard Algorithm in C++.....

This program takes user given plaintext of 8 characters(a to z) or hex input of length 16 without any spaces or if no input given, it runs on hardcoded hex message 0123456789ABCDEF and encrypts/decrypts it using Data Encryption Standard(DES)Algorithm.This code is written by Nawshad Farruque,UofL,on 29/01/2012 as an assignment of cryptography course.
