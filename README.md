Data-Encryption-Standard-Algorithm
==================================

Data Encryption Standard Algorithm in C++.

This program takes user given plaintext of 8 characters(a to z) or hex input 
of length 16 without any gaps or if no input given, it runs on hardcoded hex  
message 0123456789ABCDEF and encrypts/decrypts it using Data Encryption Standard
(DES)Algorithm.This code is written by Nawshad Farruque,Student ID:001160274,UofL,on
